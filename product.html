                <h3>Global Story</h3>
                <p>The company “On", are the first ever sports company to create a subscription based shoe service. The Cyclon shoe itself is the first product from the service. Arriving in an airy white colorway and featuring a knit upper atop a responsive foam sole, it weighs in at a mere 7 oz and is created from over 50% bio-based materials made from castor beans.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="article2">
                <h3>The problems it solves</h3>
                <p>Cyclon is On’s attempt at addressing the issue of overconsumption that has run rampant in the fashion industry. Customers that sign up for Cyclon will never actually own their gear, but rather will be “borrowing it” to use as they see fit, until the product’s lifespan has come to a close. Moreover, they’ve engineered a single-unit upper made from an undyed 100% recyclable bio-based yarn. That means zero waste. No excess material and no environmentally-harmful dyeing process. </p>
            </section>
            <section class="article3">
                <h3>How to use the innovation</h3>
                <p>The subscription model is relatively straightforward. Subscribers to Cyclon will receive shoes and apparel, which they then return to On at the end of each product’s life cycle. On will provide these subscribers with the latest models, while recycling returned items and using the raw material to create new pieces. Every 6 months you can request new running gear. When the new shoes arrive (still recyclable, obviously), put the worn out, recyclable ones in the bag and send it back.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="article4">
                <h3>Who is using it</h3>
                <p>Due to it’s affordable cost and its convenience of at home delivery, the cyclon shoes can be used by anyone, from a starting runner to a trained professional.
                Because of the extensive research and technology put into designing and producing these shoes, the average user does not have to be concerned about the comfort or shoe mechanics they normally would while looking for running shoes. They are simply shoes that offer a cushioned landing but firm take-off for optimal support and ideal for sporty people who care about sustainability.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="article5">
                <h3>What to expect</h3>
                <p>Cyclon costs $30 a month and the sneakers are built to last around 400km. That means that once you’ve run, walked, or worn your shoes for 400km, you can exchange them for a new pair. For someone running 10km a week, it would take around 40 weeks (or around 10 months) to hit the 400km benchmark. That would make the price of an On Cyclon running shoe around $300 — which is what high-end running shoes can cost at other brands.</p>

                <h3>The Future of the innovation</h3>
                <p>“There are three different types or "scopes" of emissions in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by our company. Scope 2 emissions come from the generation of energy our company uses.  
                We commit to reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 46% from 2019 to 2030.This is the level of reduction needed to keep global warming to 1.5°C – the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement”</p>
