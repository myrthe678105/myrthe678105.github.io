                    <p class="text">“The way that technology is changing pretty much everything we do, it's no surprise that someone created this Bluetooth basketball adds a technological dimension to basketball coaching. The 94Fifty Bluetooth basketball may look like a normal basketball on its dimpled orange surface, but inside is a powerful wireless sensor that can detect things like hand speed, dribbling, and even reflexes. The ball then communicates with a smartphone app available on iOS or Android that shares all the biometric readings from the ball. This way, the coach can back up their advice with hard data, and improve a player's performance based on solid metrics.”</p>

Once you've connected the sensor and downloaded the app you're able to see your tempo, swing speed, face angle, angle of attack and club shaft lean. The app even gives you a 3D visual of your swing from any angle. SwingSmart saves every swing you record and labels them "best" to "worst" so you can see what you're doing right and where you can improve.”</p>
